# VRChat Speech Assistant

<p align="center">
  <img src="./src/vrchat_speech_assistant/resources/banner.png">
</p>

The VRChat Speech Assistant allows you to use a **speech to speech, with automatic translation.**
And / or speech to text with the **VRChat chatbox** using OSC protocol.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important note about DeepL usage ‚ö†Ô∏è

This application comes with a free API key, but if it is used too much, it might not work anymore.

I recommend following [these steps](https://gitlab.com/ameliend/vrchat-speech-assistant/-/blob/main/vrchat_speech_assistant/README.md?ref_type=heads) to provide your own API key by creating an account on DeepL (free).

  <img src="./vrchat_speech_assistant/resources/screenshot.png">
</p>

1. Select your **Input device**, speak clearly, as you were in a podcast, and avoid any
   source of background noise.
1. Select a **Source language**, it is the language in which you speak for voice recognition.
2. Select a **Target language**, it is the language in which you want to speak,
   if the target language is different from the source language then the translation will be automatic.
3. Select **Speech** if you want to output the result of the recognizer to the desired audio output.
   For the speech to be transmitted to a microphone source, you need to install a
   **Virtual Cable** first, then select the audio output to **Cable Input**.
4. Select the **Voice** if available, it is linked to the target language.
5. Select **VRChat Chatbox** if you want to output into a text your recognition to the VRChat Chatbox.
   (Requires activation of the OSC feature in VRChat)

## üîå Virtual Cable setup

To be able to read your speech in VRChat, you will have to install a virtual cable first.

Then select it from the input device.
