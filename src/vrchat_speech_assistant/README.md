This application allows you to automatically **translate what you say into 30 different languages.** It uses the API of DeepL, **one of the best translators in the world. Offering a very short translation time.**

This application comes with a free API key, but if it is used too much it might not work anymore.

You can provide your own API key by creating an account DeepL (free).
